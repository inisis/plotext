## Install

Here are the terminal commands to install `plotext` on your machine:

- `pip install plotext` for normal installation and  `pip install plotext --upgrade` to upgrade to the latest [PyPi version](https://pypi.org/project/plotext).

- `pip install "plotext[image]"` to install the optional dependency necessary for **image plotting** (including GIFs).

- `pip install "plotext[video]"` to install the optional dependencies necessary for **video rendering**, which will also allow to plot images.

- `pip install "plotext[completion]"` to allow TAB completion in the [command line tool](https://github.com/piccolomo/plotext/blob/master/readme/utilities.md#command-line-tool).

- The optional packages are `pillow` (for image plotting), `opencv-python` (for video rendering), `ffpyplayer` (to stream audio), `pafy` and `youtube-dl` (to stream YouTube), `shtab` (for TAB completion).

- `pip install git+https://github.com/piccolomo/plotext`, to install the [GitHub version](https://github.com/piccolomo/plotext), if more updated and you feel courageous:
  
  - `pip install "plotext[image] @ git+https://github.com/piccolomo/plotext.git"` to include image plotting dependencies,
  - `pip install "plotext[video] @ git+https://github.com/piccolomo/plotext.git"` to include video plotting dependencies,
  - `pip install "plotext[completion] @ git+https://github.com/piccolomo/plotext.git"` to include the TAB completion dependency,

- Use the `test()` method to quickly test (up to image rendering) your newly installed version of `plotext`. This function will download and finally remove a [test image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piccolomo/plotext/master/data/cat.jpg) into your home folder. 

- Any relevant [Issue Report](https://github.com/piccolomo/plotext/issues) or [Pull request](https://github.com/piccolomo/plotext/pulls) is very welcomed. 

- The `plotext` package has been **created and tested** using Ubuntu 22.04 and Python 3.10.

## Future Ideas

From [Issue Reports](https://github.com/piccolomo/plotext/issues): 

- add OHLC date-time plots, solving [Issue 149](https://github.com/piccolomo/plotext/issues/148)
- add custom lines (dotted, or any marker), solving [Issue 145](https://github.com/piccolomo/plotext/issues/145)
- add heatmap plot, solving [Issue 143](https://github.com/piccolomo/plotext/issues/143)
- add unit testing, as suggested in [Issue 130](https://github.com/piccolomo/plotext/issues/130)

Any new relevant idea is welcomed under request, opening an [issue report](https://github.com/piccolomo/plotext/issues/new), here are some:

- add bar `alignment` parameter
- add `clear_settings()` method to clear only the plot settings (labels, title and so on) and not the data and colors
- add `matrix_plot()` side bar to connect intensity level with actual matrix value
- high resolution markers available on Windows and other rarer terminals (under request and not sure how)
- correct doc strings
- add direct parameters doc strings in the `doc` container
- remove `trend` parameter in `text()` method
- change `text` parameter to `label`  in `text()`
- change `frame` parameter to `show` in `frame()` method
- add `plotter()` function, to scatter and plot at the same time
- add `simple_hist()` function, just like `simple_bar()`
- change `colorize()` to output a `matrix_class()` object such that it can be inserted in `text()`, `indicator()` or any `label` parameter and any two objects can be easily summed as strings would. 
- allow simple plots and fast image rendering to fit in subplots 
- add matrix plot side bar 
- make simple bar plots handle negative values
- allow user to decide plot legend position and frame

## Some Questions

- Is [Consciousness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bim73icRzCk) and [Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHzAfj-62Uc) the unified truth of life, transcendent of space, time and death?
- is there a [global cabal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSqBNGxLiAs&list=PLnzMmEt4pIb83lZgEA3nALsDM1QogyvC0&index=17) of psychopaths/narcissists trying to manipulate humanity through fear and ignorance? If so, are they a manifestation of our collective shadow or ego? 
- Is it possible then, that collective [shadow work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgvrUi8BIWw), or ego-transcendence, is the most important effort humanity as a whole needs to face in order to evolve spiritually?

If so, could the deep state and the military industrial complex have any interest in portraying them in the future as a treat to humanity to justify the militarization of space?
- What in the world is actually going on in [Hollywood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbNknirhUeA)? 

Your choice deciding the answer to such fundamental questions. I made mine a long time ago. My mind and heart is set free!
